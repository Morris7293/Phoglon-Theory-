The Phoglon Theory proposes a groundbreaking unification of photons and gluons, two fundamental particles in quantum physics, aiming to explain the emergence of matter from energy, particularly under conditions of singularity. Central to this theory is the "Morris Constant," a theoretical constant introduced to describe the dynamic interaction between photons, gluons, and curved spacetime. The theory suggests that, in high-energy environments such as those found in black holes or during the Big Bang, photons and gluons interact in a way that generates matter and contributes to the curvature of spacetime.

This novel approach builds upon established quantum mechanics and general relativity but seeks to bridge their gaps by addressing the origins of mass and energy unification at a quantum level. By exploring the deep relationship between light (photons), nuclear forces (gluons), and spacetime geometry, the Phoglon Theory aims to extend our understanding of the fabric of reality, potentially reshaping fundamental physics. The theory holds significant implications for cosmology, black hole dynamics, quantum gravity, and particle physics, while also offering philosophical insights into the origin and interconnectedness of matter, energy, and spacetime.
